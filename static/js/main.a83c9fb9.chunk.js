I\'ve been at J.D. Power for four years, we\'re a Microsoft shop, but still kinda old school. My role was kind of a jack of all trades, I worked on Ads, Automated QA, DevOps, Product Management, Design, to name a few. I do quantitative investing on the side, basically just some math and models to combine and play with the stock market. I also play a lot of basketball, trying to get back into shape.

We\'ve all worked with people who are stubborn and I\'m more relaxed and more towards letting others lead if I know they\'re capable, but I\'ll still present my opinion if I\'m confident in mine. So I was working with the dev on some logging application I noticed that there was a kind of weird try/catch situation going on so I proposed a different pattern. But the dev rejected it. So when working with people that have different personalities, there\'s still commonalities, so knowing this person, he was extremely analytical and wants concrete real-world examples. So I played to that strength, engineering a scenario that I knew would display the faults in the design, and he accepted that. He proceded to tear apart my solution to the problem as well, which I also accepted, we ended up with a kinda hybrid/combined solution that we were both happy with."],"section":"Behaviorial"},{"question":"Give me an example of a time you faced a conflict while working on a team.

While we were planning on working on this already, it was only supposed to be for one section of the site as a trial run, and we didn\'t know about the sale to begin with. Our team (devs, business/product) was tasked to work on this. A lot of us were stressed out, myself included, and at some point during a standup, two of the engineers just started yelling at each other. So a couple hours after the standup, both of them each went to me, almost one after the other, and took a break for a walk and just started ranting. At that point, this was early in my career, I guess I kind of understood that kind of stuff just happens and its good to have someone to listen to and air complaints.
